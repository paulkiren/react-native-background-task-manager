## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16 or higher
- React Native development environment
- Android SDK and tools
- Git

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/react-native-background-task-manager.git
cd react-native-background-task-manager
```

3. Add the upstream remote:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/react-native-background-task-manager.git
```

## Development Setup

### Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install root dependencies
npm install

# Install example app dependencies
cd example
npm install
cd ..
```

### Build the Library

```bash
# Build TypeScript and generate types
npm run prepare

# Run TypeScript compiler
npm run typescript

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run tests
npm test
```

### Running Examples

```bash
# Start Metro bundler
npm start

# Run Android example (in another terminal)
npx react-native run-android

# Run with specific device
npx react-native run-android --deviceId YOUR_DEVICE_ID
```

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

- `feature/add-new-service-type` - New features
- `fix/permission-request-issue` - Bug fixes
- `docs/update-api-reference` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/improve-task-manager` - Code refactoring
- `test/add-service-tests` - Test additions

### Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting:

```bash
# Check formatting
npm run format:check

# Fix formatting
npm run format

# Check linting
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix
```

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions/changes
- `chore`: Build process or tool changes

Examples:
```
feat(service): add support for Android 15 service types

fix(permissions): resolve notification permission request on Android 13+

docs(api): update service configuration examples

test(task-manager): add comprehensive task scheduling tests
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- ForegroundService.test.ts
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in `__tests__/` directory
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases
- Mock external dependencies

Example test structure:

```typescript
describe('ForegroundService', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.clearAllMocks();
  });

  describe('startService', () => {
    it('should start service with valid options', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });

    it('should throw error for invalid options', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

### Testing on Device

```bash
# Check if service is running
adb shell dumpsys activity services | grep ForegroundService

# View logs
adb logcat | grep ReactNative

# Install and test APK
cd example/android
./gradlew assembleDebug
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Documentation

### API Documentation

- Update `docs/API.md` for API changes
- Include code examples
- Document breaking changes
- Update TypeScript definitions

### README Updates

- Keep README.md concise and focused
- Update installation instructions if needed
- Add new features to feature list
- Update compatibility information

### Code Comments

- Use JSDoc for public methods
- Explain complex logic
- Document Android-specific behavior
- Include usage examples

Example:

```typescript
/**
 * Starts a foreground service with the specified configuration.
 * 
 * @param options - Service configuration options
 * @returns Promise that resolves when service starts
 * @throws Error if service fails to start or permissions are missing
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * await ForegroundService.startService({
 *   taskName: 'DataSync',
 *   taskTitle: 'Syncing Data',
 *   taskDesc: 'Synchronizing with server...',
 *   serviceType: 'dataSync'
 * });
 * ```
 */
async startService(options: ForegroundServiceOptions): Promise<void>
```
